Structure requests should have to be processed in the backend.

```
{
    "model": {
        "id": "id",
        "function": "f(x)",
        "args": {
            "policies": {
                "pol1": array (Ã  mettre en string),
                "pol2": ...
            },
            "demographics": {
                "gdp": "val",
                "density": "val",
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Where `id` can be one of the following: <br>
* i don't know yet

`function` and `args`are simply the function you'd like to call on the required model with some given arguments. <br>

You should find documentation for every functions directly in the models files.
